Table S1 set 2 part comes from the `alfam2pars02` object in v2.0 of the ALFAM2 package (here: <https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2/releases/tag/v2.0>. 
Note that parameter set E (in manuscript) is called set b in the scripts.
Set a in the scripts is not mentioned in the manuscript.

Section 3.1 states "Wind tunnel air exchange rate (AER) had a clear effect on measured emission, with a similar response in the two trials where it varied widely (p = 1·10-5 for AER effect, p = 0.99 for interaction based on an F test from a regression model)." come from results from `summary(m1)` or `drop1(m1, test = 'F')` (for main AER effect) and similar for `m2` (for interation) in `output/stats.pdf`, which is created by `scripts-meas/stats.Rmd`.

Section 2.3.2 info on gap filling ("...with filtered data removed...") is from `gapeffect` column in `output/emis_summ.csv`, which is generated by scripts `scripts-meas/summary.R` and `scripts-meas/export.R`.

Plot keys (pmid) in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 come from `output/pmid_summ.csv`, which is just a column subset of `pdat` created in `scripts-meas/summary.R` and exported in `scripts-meas/export.R`.
More detailed information on pmid (linking to trials and conditions) is also in `output/emis_summ.csv` and `output/int_summ.csv` from `scripts-meas/export.R`.
