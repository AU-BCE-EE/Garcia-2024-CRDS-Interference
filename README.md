# Overview
This repo contains all the data and data processing scripts needed to produce the results presented in the paper listed above.
The scripts run in R (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and require several add-on packages.

# Directory structure

## `H2O Interferences`
Measurement data and scripts on H2O interference.
Use scripts `H2O_Test1&2.R` and `H2O_Test3.R`.

## `NH3 Interferences`
Measurement data and scripts on NH3 interference.
Use scripts `Calibration_NH3.R` and `NH3_Interferences.R`.

## `VOC Interferences`
Measurement data and scripts on VOC interference.
Use scripts `PTRdata_Picarrodata_Timeallign_Example.R` and `VOC_Interferences.R`.

# Links to paper
This section give the sources of tables and figures presented in the paper.

**Figure 3** is generated with R scripts `H2O_Test1&2.R` and `H2O_Test3.R`. These scripts are used to read the raw data from the CRDS, select the stable intervals, and calculate the means and standard deviation. The plot is generated by merging means and standard deviations for NH3, N2O, and CH4 from both R scripts. First, `H2O_Test3.R` is run to create the data frame for Test 3, then, `H2O_Test1&2.R` is run to create the data frame for Tests 1 and 2, and the plots.

**Figure 4** is generated with R script NH3_Interferences.R´. This script is used to read the raw data from the CRDS, select stable intervals, and calculate the means and standard deviation of N2O and NH3. The script ´Calibration_NH3.R´ is used to read the data for NH3 calibration up to 16ppm and the values of background N2O and CH4, which will be used to generate figure 4b and c. The full merged figure 4 is generated with ´NH3_Interferences.R´

**Figure 5** is generated with R script ´VOC_Interferences.R´. The scripts ´VOC_TimeAllign_1.R´, ´VOC_TimeAllign_2.R´, ´VOC_TimeAllign_3.R´, ´VOC_TimeAllign_4.R´ are used to read CRDS data, PTR-TOF data, align time of PTR-TOF and each CRDS, calculate means and standard deviations.
